                          <h2>We are followers of Jesus</h2>
                          <br/>
                          <h3>Why Jesus?</h3>
                          <h3>Let us tell you the story of why we’re followers of Jesus in three parts.</h3>  
                          <br/>
                          <h3>1. The Manger</h3>
                          <p>
                            Jesus Christ was born in a Bethlehem manger two thousand years ago. Yet today
                            billions of people all over the world follow him. Why? Christians believe that God
                            loved the world so much that he sent his Son on a rescue mission. Christians
                            believe Jesus Christ is God’s eternal Son who came to save the world.
                          </p>

                          <h3>2. The Cross</h3>
                          <p>
                            ‘Saving from what?’ you might say. We don’t need to look far to realise there’s
                            something wrong with the world. In fact, if we take an honest look at our own lives
                            we know the problem is much closer to home. The Bible says that the problem with
                            the world and each one of us is our separation from God. Our Creator made us for
                            relationship. Back in the beginning of the story, the Bible tells us that we were in a
                            place where we had harmony in our relationship with God and one another
                            (Genesis 1-2). Everything was good. But then humanity turned from God and left
                            that place of peace. From that day on the cosmic order of the world has been
                            thrown out (Genesis 3). We are suffering the consequences of being separated
                            from the Fountain of all life and goodness. From the very beginning, God promised
                            to send a Saviour who would rescue us and bring us back home. But there was a
                            huge cost. <br/><br/>

                            Think of it like this, every wrong thing you have ever thought or acted on is kept in a
                            file. One day the file will be opened and you will be judged on it. Does that make
                            you feel like hiding? Well on the cross Jesus wiped that file from existence and took
                            your judgement. But the good news doesn’t stop here. The moment you trust in
                            Jesus, your file gets swapped with his. You get his perfect record and he takes your
                            bad record. Now there’s no longer a need for you to hide from God and others. Your
                            guilt and shame has been taken away. The cross means you are fully forgiven and
                            fully free. Your relationship with God is restored.
                          </p>

                          <h3>3. The King</h3>
                          <p>
                            Three days after Jesus died on the cross, he rose from the dead. This was the
                            moment life triumphed over death. Death is horrible isn’t it. It separates loved ones.
                            It causes so much pain and grief. Death is a consequence of us being separated
                            from God, the source of all life. The resurrection of Jesus from the dead proves God
                            really does care about us and his world. God hasn’t abandoned us but raised up
                            Jesus to show a new era has begun. Jesus resurrection is the sure promise of a
                            new creation. The historical resurrection of Jesus proves that this is all true. Death
                            won’t have the last say but there is another chapter in the story. In Revelation, the
                            last book of the Bible, we are told of a future hope. A place without suffering or evil.
                            No more tears, sorrow, pain or death but all things made new (Revelation 21-22).
                            Heaven and earth will be joined together again. God will dwell with his people
                            forever. <br/><br/>

                            <em>“If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.” (Mark 8:34)</em><br/><br/>

                            BPC is a bunch of ordinary people who follow King Jesus. We live in
                            response to what Jesus has done for us. Because Jesus is King, we place his
                            agenda above our own agenda, and the needs of others above our own
                            needs. We know this is costly but we serve a King who gave his life for us.
                            Plus being a Christian isn’t a solo project. When Jesus ascended into heaven
                            he sent his Holy Spirit and gives us a community of believers to help us.
                          </p>

                          <h2>We are on mission together</h2>
                          <p>
                            <em>
                            “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
                            Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I
                            have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the
                            age.” (Matt. 28:19-20) </em> <br/><br/>

                            This time in between Jesus ascension into heaven and his return, is a time for
                            God’s rescue mission to continue. Before Jesus ascended he told his
                            followers to go into all of the world and make disciples of all nations. And he
                            told them to do it ‘as they go’. This means as we live our lives for Jesus in
                            community, we encourage others to do the same. As we’re at home, work,
                            school or uni, playing sport or whatever we do, we make disciples of Jesus as
                            we go. Jesus died on a cross, rose from the dead, and told us he is coming
                            back to earth anytime soon. So the best use of our short time is to live for
                            him, and teach others to do the same.
                            
                          </p>

                          <h2>We are evangelical and reformed</h2>
                          <p>
                          The word ‘evangelical’ comes from the greek word that means ‘gospel’. The gospel
                          is God’s powerful message to save the world. And it’s for all people, in all places,
                          at all times. The gospel answers our deepest questions about life and death, and
                          fulfils our deepest longings. For this reason it’s always relevant and as evangelicals
                          we want to place the gospel at the front and centre of all we do. <br/> <br/>
